## Technologies Used:
HTML
CSS
Bootstrap 5
JavaScript

## Learning Experience



## User Stories

## Setting Up Core Structure
Prior to starting the desktop design, I re-wireframed it with a mobile-first methodology and created that layout first. With the help of HTML/Bootstrap, I centered the background on the HTML element, and then I used a combination of absolute, relative, fixed, and static positioning in order to achieve this layout. Layering the containers on top of each other required use of the z-index property.

## Arranging the elements on the page using Bootstrap, Flexbox, and CSS.

## Focusing on User Experience / Accessability
With the mindset of "mobile first" elements are stacked on the site. One of the concerns was making the modal center to the page on mobile. By using a @media query with a max width of 600px, the site is centered on an iPhone13. I arranged the rest of the elements using a combination of Bootstrap 5 classes, Flexbox, and vanilla CSS.


## Problem Areas/Blockers


## Future Directions
In the future, I'd like to utilize more of Bootstrap's built in classes and SASS to normalize the stylesheet for deployment in the wild. I'd also like to rebuild it using functional components in VueJS as opposed to traditional DOM manipulation.
